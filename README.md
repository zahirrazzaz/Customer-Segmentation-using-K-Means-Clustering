Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
## 📊 Overview

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** (KMeans clustering) to segment customers based on behavioral data from a credit card usage dataset. The goal is to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

### 🔍 Objectives

- Perform **EDA** to understand customer patterns.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Apply **KMeans clustering** to group customers.
- Visualize and interpret the segments.
- Deliver data-driven recommendations to improve customer targeting.

### 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Silhouette Score & Elbow Method for optimal K

### 📁 Dataset
